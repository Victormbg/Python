# Atari Pong 1972
A simple 2D pong game with realistic physics against AI made with Pygame on Python 3.6. 
                The game parameters can be changed from the constants.py file, for ex to make 
                the AI ​​more aggressive, go ahead and reduce the values AI_MAX_REACT and MAX_ERR_INT.
                
Nota bene : It's my very first program in python, I didn't even know about PEP8 and stuff, so don't take this source as reference ;)
